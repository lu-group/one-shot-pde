# One-shot learning for solution operators of partial differential equations

The data and code for the paper [One-shot learning for solution operators of partial differential equations](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-63076-z), *Nature Communications*, 16, 8386, 2025.

## Data

The datasets in the study are generated directly from the code in [data](data) folder. For the following experiments, the data can be found on OneDrive:
- [Data for 2D nonlinear Poisson with a circle cutout](https://yaleedu-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/r/personal/lu_lu_yale_edu/Documents/datasets/2025_NatCommun_Jiao?csf=1&web=1&e=zTMg9C) generated by COMSOL

## Code

The code for training the local solution operators, FPI, LOINN and cLOINN approaches can be found in [src](src). Each folder within this directory is named according to the PDEs. Files ending in "_G.py" is the code for training the local solution operators. Files ending with "FPI", "cLOINN", or "LOINN" correspond to each approach. A Jupyter Notebook example for the nonlinear diffusionâ€“reaction equation is provided here: ðŸ“˜[Example_nonlinear_diffusion-reaction_equation.ipynb](src/Example_nonlinear_diffusion-reaction_equation.ipynb).
